# AI-Powered Abstract Summarization Feature Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the specification for an AI-powered abstract summarization feature that will automatically generate comprehensive summaries of abstracts for searched topics or recent papers (within the last week). This feature will help users quickly understand trends and developments in their areas of interest.

## Feature Description

### Core Functionality

The AI summarization feature will provide two main capabilities:

1. **Topic-Based Summarization**: Generate summaries based on search queries/topics
2. **Recent Papers Summarization**: Automatically summarize abstracts from papers published in the last week

### Use Cases

1. **Researcher Workflow**: A researcher searching for "transformer architecture" can get an AI-generated summary of recent developments and trends
2. **Weekly Updates**: Users can receive weekly summaries of new papers in their field of interest
3. **Trend Analysis**: Identify emerging themes and patterns across multiple papers
4. **Quick Insights**: Get concise overviews without reading individual abstracts

## Technical Specification

### 1. Data Input

**For Topic-Based Summarization**:
- Input: Search query/topic keywords
- Source: Papers matching the search criteria
- Scope: All papers in database or within specified date range

**For Recent Papers Summarization**:
- Input: Time range (default: last 7 days)
- Source: Papers published within the specified time range
- Scope: All papers or filtered by categories/keywords

### 2. AI Integration Options

**Option A: OpenAI API Integration**
- Service: OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo
- Pros: High-quality summaries, established API
- Cons: API costs, external dependency

**Option B: Local LLM Integration**

    A[User Request] --> B[Paper Selection]
    B --> C[Abstract Extraction]
    C --> D[Text Preprocessing]
    D --> E[AI Summarization]
    E --> F[Post-processing]
    F --> G[Response Formatting]
    G --> H[Cache Storage]
```

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Paper Selection**:
   - Query database for relevant papers
   - Apply filters (date range, topic, keywords)
   - Limit to reasonable number (e.g., 50-100 papers)

2. **Abstract Extraction**:
   - Extract abstracts from selected papers
   - Remove duplicates and low-quality content
   - Validate text quality and length

3. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and normalize text
   - Remove special characters and formatting
   - Chunk text if necessary for token limits

4. **AI Summarization**:
   - Send processed text to AI service
   - Apply appropriate prompts for different summary types
   - Handle API rate limits and errors

5. **Post-processing**:
   - Format and structure the summary
   - Add metadata (paper count, date range, etc.)
   - Validate output quality

6. **Response Formatting**:
   - Structure response for frontend consumption
   - Add relevant paper citations
   - Include summary statistics

### 4. API Design

    "date_range": {
      "start": "2023-11-01",
      "end": "2023-11-08"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "generated_at": "2023-11-08T10:30:00Z",
    "ai_model": "gpt-4",
    "processing_time": 12.5,
    "top_papers": [
      {
        "title": "Attention Is All You Need",
        "authors": ["Vaswani, A."],
